#  prophet-challenge
> Module 8 Challenge for ASU AI Bootcamp

I did this assignment on my own, but there's a high possibility I help others as they experience challenges with their own code

In this challenge, we act as a growth analyst at [Mercado Libre](https://investor.mercadolibre.com/). With over 200 million users, Mercado Libre is the most popular e-commerce site in Latin America. As a growth analyst, I analyzed the company's financial and user data in clever ways to make the company grow. The goal is to find out if the ability to predict search traffic can translate into the ability to successfully trade the stock.

The steps for this Challenge are divided as such:

Step 1: Find unusual patterns in hourly Google search traffic.

Step 2: Mine the search traffic data for seasonality.

Step 3: Relate the search traffic to stock price patterns.

Step 4: Create a time series model with Prophet.

## Installing / Getting started

Open the forecasting_net.ipynb Jupyter notebook using a Jupyter server. Explore the data.

```jupyter lab

```

Run each part of the code in the notebook to explore the data. Note that some of the code is provided to confirm dataset information and to create the requirements for this project.
